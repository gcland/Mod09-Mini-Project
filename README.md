Welcome to Module-9-Mini-Project: Task Management Application with Bootstrap by Grant Copeland

Begin by downloading files and opening 'index.html'; this is the homepage of the Task Management Application. From the home page you will be able to access the features of the application:

- The home page features a nav bar at the top, a large intro section, ca arousel of two featured tasks, and cards to link to different pages at the bottom.

- The nav bar has links to the dashboard page, the edit task page, the create task page, sign in page, and register page. All pages are responsive and collapse at medium or large screen sizes to be in a column format for smaller screen sizes (mobile).

- The cards at the bottom of the home page route to the dashboard page, the edit task page, and the create task page.

- Use the dashboard or the cards at the bottom to route to various points within the Task Management Application.

- The sign in and register pages requires information to be inserted within the forms before submitting (validation). These pages' navigation only link home as the user would be required to sign in or register before accessing the key functions of the application.

- The dashboard (details page) shows all tasks. The dashboard is broken into 2 columns for larger screen sizes; 2/3 of the screen is for the progress bar showing the % complete by a task. 1/3 of the screen is for an accordion-style task detail section. Clicking on the task details button called opens a window to show the items within the task. The navigation bar routes home, to the edit task page, or to the create task page.

- The create task page features a form for the user to fill out with the task name, the task items or steps, a textarea for any notes or additional details, and a section to upload a file. The navigation bar for this page routes home, to the dashboard page, or to the edit task page.

- The edit task page is similar to the create task page; features a form for the user to fill out with the task items or steps, a textarea for any notes or additional details, and a section to upload a file. The first section requires you to select any existing task from a dropdown menu. The navigation bar for this section routes home, to the dashboard page, or to the edit task page.
